## **Troubleshooting**
1. **Git Command Errors:**
   - Ensure Git is installed and configured correctly.
   - Verify that the remote repository URL is correct.

2. **Permission Denied (SSH):**
   - Ensure your SSH key is added to your GitHub account.
   - Follow GitHubâ€™s guide to set up SSH: [GitHub SSH Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).
